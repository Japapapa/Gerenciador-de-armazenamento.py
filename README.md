The stock manager born to be a project to improve my skills in program logic and to train python.

19/12/23:
    I started this stock manager two weeks ago. I had to take a break because i started to learn machine leraning and i was needed to improve my skills in OOP (Object Orientation Programing). OOP is very dificult for me, but now, i really believe that i can take this forward.
    I go back to work.
    (note: somethings in my code would be a little bit messy, but during the project i will adjust that things. Enjoy this journey :)  )
